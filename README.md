# Personal Pelican Site
This repository contains the full Pelican configuration/build for my [github pages site](http://pmbaumgartner.github.io).

Most of the creation, styling, and deployment details are detailed in the blog post "Some Tips for Using Jupyter Notebooks with Pelican".

The `output` folder contains a git submodule that tied to the github pages repository.
