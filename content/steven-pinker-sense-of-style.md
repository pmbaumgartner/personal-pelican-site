Summary: A writing reminder

> As Thomas and Turner explain, "Accuracy becomes pedantry if it is indulged for its own sake. A classic writer will phrase a subordinate point precisely but without the promise that it is technically accurate. The convention between writer and the reader is that the writer is not to be challenged on these points because they are mere scaffolding." Any adversary who is unscrupulous enough to give the least charitable reading to an unhedged statement will find an opening to attack the writer in a thicket of hedged ones anyway.

I frequently struggle with the confidence to write something technical without a full and complete understanding of all the nuance of a concept. I am a harsh judge of my own understanding, too. Most of my hesitancy comes from imagined scenarios of experts calling me out the accuracy of my statements, which is both unlikely and (by the above statement) pedantic. I should consider this: if my intent is to inform, and I've done enough research to use the concept I'm trying to explain, then I should be comfortable with the knowledge I have and proceed with writing. The likelihood that a reader's knowledge on the whole will be improved, rather than harmed, is assumed.

*Progress, not perfection.*
